## User Stories/Use Cases

* **As a language learner (end user)**, I want to study more than one language at the same time. For example, I maybe be an English speaker learning both Japanese and Korean through a flashcards app. These languages may have distinct learning rates, failure rates, etc. For example, I don't want my slowness in learning Japanese to affect my flashcards in Korean, where I excel.
* **As a UI Backend developer**, I want to have multiple languages dealt with on the same `morphcards` instantiation.

## Functional Requirements

* **Core Functionality:** 

  * \[Feature 1\]: When different languages are added concurrently, they are treated separetely. They may share the same duckdb database, but will have distinct indices. This means that the SSR algorithm will treat them separately, computing metrics independently for each Language track.
